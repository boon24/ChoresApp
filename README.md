## Overview
### Description
An application that allows users to create groups with others, and create/assign tasks to certain users. Tasks can also be randomly assigned to a user, and can rotate through the group. Tasks can be repeated weekly, monthly, or yearly. Users can optionally create tasks for themselves and not join a group.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Productivity
- **Mobile:** The app would first be produced for mobile devices, but there is no reason it wouldn't sync across all devices. It would be more simple to use on mobile devices.
- **Story:** Assigns users to perform certain tasks, and keeps track of which tasks have been completed or not. A report summarizing the status of all tasks within a group is provided to all members of the group by the end of the week.
- **Market:** This app could be used for many different purposes regarding teamwork. The primary demographic would be college students looking for an app to keep a list of chores to do in their apartments.
- **Habit:** This app would be used at the least weekly, to check what tasks need to be done for the person and what everyone else must do.
- **Scope:** We would begin with connecting users and allowing them to create tasks. We would potentially evolve into integrating these tasks within the Calendar app and allowing people on all devices to join a group.
